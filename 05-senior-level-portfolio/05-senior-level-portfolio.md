## Portfolio Components

### Capstone Project

**Objective:** Select one of the more complex challenge projects (e.g., the fine-tuned LLM or the deployed API) and polish it into a portfolio centerpiece.

**Deliverables:**

- Write a detailed blog post or README explaining the problem, your process, the architecture, and the results.
- Demonstrate end-to-end understanding from problem formulation to deployment.
- Show technical depth while maintaining clear communication for both technical and non-technical audiences.

**Success Criteria:**

- Well-documented code with clear architecture decisions
- Comprehensive testing and evaluation
- Production-ready deployment considerations
- Clear documentation of lessons learned and future improvements

### ML System Design

**Objective:** Practice ML system design interview questions to demonstrate senior-level thinking.

**Key Areas to Cover:**

- **Real-time Systems:** Design architecture for systems like real-time fraud detection services
- **Recommendation Systems:** Design personalized content feeds or product recommendations
- **Scaling Considerations:** Handle large-scale data processing and model serving
- **Trade-offs:** Balance between accuracy, latency, cost, and maintainability

**Practice Exercises:**

- Whiteboard the architecture for complex ML systems
- Consider data pipeline design, model training infrastructure, and serving architecture
- Address monitoring, A/B testing, and model updates in production
- Design for reliability, scalability, and observability

### Paper Implementation

**Objective:** Pick a foundational paper in your area of interest and implement it from scratch.

**Recommended Papers:**

- **Transformers:** "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017)
- **Computer Vision:** "ResNet" (He et al., 2016) or "Vision Transformer" (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020)
- **Generative Models:** "Generative Adversarial Networks" (Goodfellow et al., 2014)
- **Reinforcement Learning:** "Deep Q-Network" (Mnih et al., 2015)

**Implementation Requirements:**

- Build the model architecture from scratch (not using pre-built components)
- Reproduce key experimental results from the paper
- Document your understanding of the paper's contributions
- Compare your implementation's performance to reported results
- Identify and explain any differences or challenges encountered

**Success Criteria:**

- Demonstrates deep technical understanding beyond surface-level knowledge
- Shows ability to read, understand, and implement complex research
- Provides clear documentation of implementation choices and trade-offs
- Proves capability to work with cutting-edge techniques independently
