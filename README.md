# ML/AI Learning Path

This document outlines a self-study curriculum designed for an experienced software engineer to transition into a senior-level Machine Learning or AI role.

## Learning Phases

### [Phase 1: Foundational Knowledge](./01-foundational-knowledge/01-foundational-knowledge.md)

**Goal:** Solidify the mathematical and programming fundamentals upon which all of ML is built.

Build your foundation in:

- Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, transformations, PCA)
- Statistics and Probability (distributions, hypothesis testing, Bayes' theorem)
- Calculus for ML (derivatives, gradients, optimization)

### [Phase 2: Core Machine Learning Concepts](./02-core-machine-learning-concepts/02-core-machine-learning-concepts.md)

**Goal:** Understand the "what" and "why" behind traditional ML models.

Master the essentials:

- Supervised Learning (regression, classification, decision trees, SVMs)
- Unsupervised Learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Model Building & Evaluation (bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation, metrics)

### [Phase 3: Deep Learning & Modern AI](./03-deep-learning-modern-ai/03-deep-learning-modern-ai.md)

**Goal:** Move from traditional ML to modern deep learning and AI applications.

Explore the frontier:

- Neural Networks and Backpropagation
- Convolutional Neural Networks (Computer Vision)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (NLP/Sequences)
- Attention and Transformers
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Generative AI (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models)

### [Phase 4: Production & MLOps](./04-production-mlops/04-production-mlops.md)

**Goal:** Bridge the gap from model development to production-ready systems.

Learn to deploy and scale:

- MLOps and Deployment (versioning, containerization, APIs)
- Ethical & Responsible AI (bias detection, fairness, explainability)
- Advanced Systems & Optimization (distributed training, performance)

### [Phase 5: Senior-Level Portfolio](./05-senior-level-portfolio/05-senior-level-portfolio.md)

**Goal:** Synthesize all learned skills into tangible proof of your capabilities.

Build your portfolio:

- Capstone Project
- ML System Design
- Paper Implementation
